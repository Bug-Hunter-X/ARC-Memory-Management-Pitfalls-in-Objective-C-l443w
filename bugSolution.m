The solution focuses on correcting the memory management issue.  Instead of repeatedly creating new `NSString` instances, we can either reuse the existing string or use a weak reference if we don't need to keep ownership. 

```objectivec
@interface MyClass : NSObject
@property (strong, nonatomic) NSMutableString *myString;
@end

@implementation MyClass
- (void)someMethod {
    if (!self.myString) {
        self.myString = [NSMutableString stringWithFormat:@"Hello, world!"];
    }
    [self.myString setString:@"Modified string!"];
    // ... some code ...
}
@end
```

By using `NSMutableString` and modifying it in place, we avoid creating new objects with each call.  This change corrects the memory leak.  Alternatively, if the modification isn't required, a weak reference could be a viable approach, if appropriate for the context.
