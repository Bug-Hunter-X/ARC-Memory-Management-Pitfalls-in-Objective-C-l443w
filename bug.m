In Objective-C, a common yet subtle error arises when dealing with memory management using ARC (Automatic Reference Counting).  Consider the following scenario:

```objectivec
@interface MyClass : NSObject
@property (strong, nonatomic) NSString *myString;
@end

@implementation MyClass
- (void)someMethod {
    self.myString = [NSString stringWithFormat:@"Hello, world!"];
    // ... some code ...
}
@end
```

If `someMethod` is called multiple times, each call creates a new `NSString`.  If you intend to modify `myString` in place rather than create new objects each time, the existing strong reference prevents the deallocation of the old string, creating a memory leak. 

Another potential issue is with the use of `copy` instead of `strong`. Copying the string always allocates new memory, potentially creating unnecessary load. Choosing between `strong`, `copy` and `weak` property attributes can be confusing and might lead to memory leak or unexpected behavior.
